      A restaurant is a place <br />
where you can sit down and relax,<br />
             and 
    let someone else do the <br />
       cooking for you.<br/>
       A great restaurant is one that <br/>
       just makes you feel like you're not <br/>
       sure whether you went out or you <br/>
       came home and confuses you. <br/>
       If it can do both of those<br/>
      things at the same time, <br/>
      you're hooked.<br/>
